# BMI Calculator
This project is a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator. It presents a form to the user to input their weight and height, and calculates their BMI to display the result. It also provides a recommendation based on the user's BMI value.

# How It Works
The user enters their weight and height in kilograms and meters.
When the "Calculate BMI" button is clicked, the BMI is calculated based on the entered values.
The calculated BMI value is displayed on the screen.
Depending on the BMI value, a recommendation is provided to the user.
Clicking the "Reset" button clears the input fields and hides the BMI result and recommendation.
